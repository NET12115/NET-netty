  <title>Introduction to DocBook processing</title>
  <para>DocBook is an XML format for writing documents. It allows the author to
        focus on the content itself during the writing process instead of
        worrying about the presentation. </para>
  <para>Using standard DocBook tags, we can tag the content according to
        its syntatic structure. The DocBook document is then processed using
        XSL stylesheets so that each tagged DocBook element is transformed to a
        corresponding element in the target output format. For example each &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; element in DocBook could be transformed into a &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; element in XHTML. </para>
  <para>Using different XSL stylesheets, we can generate different
        output formats. For example, we can generate both XHTML and PDF outputs from
        a single DocBook source. We can also generate multiple versions of XHTML
        (or PDF) files each with a different  style if necessary.</para>
  <para>In the JBoss DocBook system, we provide XSL stylesheets to build XHTML, PDF and Eclipse Help output formats from the DocBook source. The build process is
        illustrated in <xref linkend="build.fig"/>. </para>

  <para>XHTML is used  instead of HTML as it ensures  that the content is completely separated from  its style using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and image files.</para>

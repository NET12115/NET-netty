/**
 * A helper class which creates a new client-side {@link Channel} and makes a
 * connection attempt.
 *
 * <h3>Configuring a channel</h3>
 *
 * {@link #setOption(String, Object) Options} are used to configure a channel:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ClientBootstrap b = ...;
 *
 * // Options for a new channel
 * b.setOption("remoteAddress", new {@link InetSocketAddress}("example.com", 8080));
 * b.setOption("tcpNoDelay", true);
 * b.setOption("receiveBufferSize", 1048576);
 * </pre>
 *
 * For the detailed list of available options, please refer to
 * {@link ChannelConfig} and its sub-types
 *
 * <h3>Configuring a channel pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Every channel has its own {@link ChannelPipeline} and you can configure it
 * in two ways.
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain #setPipeline(ChannelPipeline) The first approach} is to use
 * the default pipeline and let the bootstrap to shallow-copy the default
 * pipeline for each new channel:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ClientBootstrap b = ...;
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p = b.getPipeline();
 *
 * // Add handlers to the pipeline.
 * p.addLast("encoder", new EncodingHandler());
 * p.addLast("decoder", new DecodingHandler());
 * p.addLast("logic",   new LogicHandler());
 * </pre>
 *
 * Please note 'shallow-copy' here means that the added {@link ChannelHandler}s
 * are not cloned but only their references are added to the new pipeline.
 * Therefore, you have to choose the second approach if you are going to open
 * more than one {@link Channel} whose {@link ChannelPipeline} contains any
 * {@link ChannelHandler} whose {@link ChannelPipelineCoverage} is {@code "one"}.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@linkplain #setPipelineFactory(ChannelPipelineFactory) The second approach}
 * is to specify a {@link ChannelPipelineFactory} by yourself and have full
 * control over how a new pipeline is created.  This approach is more complex
 * than the first approach while it is much more flexible:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ClientBootstrap b = ...;
 * b.setPipelineFactory(new MyPipelineFactory());
 *
 * public class MyPipelineFactory implements {@link ChannelPipelineFactory} {
 *   // Create a new pipeline for a new channel and configure it here ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Applying different settings for different {@link Channel}s</h3>
 *
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} is just a helper class.  It neither allocates nor
 * manages any resources.  What manages the resources is the
 * {@link ChannelFactory} implementation you specified in the constructor of
 * {@link ClientBootstrap}.  Therefore, it is OK to create as many
 * {@link ClientBootstrap} instances as you want to apply different settings
 * for different {@link Channel}s.
